# InfoVizProjects
This is for information visualization projects
I have recreated the GapMinder World visualisation on life expectancy rate vs GDP for the various countries in the range of year1900 to 2016.
By using the SVG tags, html, CSS and D3Js I have made visualization on GapMinder world population data set.
PART 1- As per the graphs I have shown, the countries are divided into 8 regions which are Europe, Asia, Africa, North America, South America,
Australia, "Central America and Oceania. So, each region is displayed with some colour coding which are shown in the graph.
Countries are labelled with their names and when we bring the mouse of any country it will show the Country name, 
Population and code of the country. Also, when we click on the bubble of any specific country it shows the region of that countries and 
all the other countries belongs to that same region will be shown and other countries will get blurred.
In this way we can see the data for any given country when bring the mouse over the country bubble. 
The animation are running while moving the mouse. 

PART 2- The new feature we have came up with in part 2 is showing the data of Life expectancy and GDP over the years by bringing the mouse 
on the year number displayed in the graph. So, we have implemented the mouse hover functionality in order to see the data over the years.
Besides, we have shown the countries by the region, as if user click on the country in the bubble then region of that specific county 
will show along with all the other countries belong to that region.
In addition to that, we have shown the country wise data for all the given years in the scatter plot. When the used select the country and
the year and click on the play button, plot will be shown.
